            <p>
                Prison Island, also known as Changuu Island, is a small island located approximately 5.6 kilometers northwest of Stone Town, the historic center of Zanzibar City, in Tanzania. The island is a popular tourist destination known for its pristine beaches, historical significance, and its resident population of Aldabra giant tortoises.

Originally, Prison Island was intended to serve as a prison for rebellious slaves in the late 19th century under the rule of the Sultanate of Zanzibar. However, the prison was never fully utilized for its intended purpose, and instead, it was used as a quarantine station for African slaves who were being transported to Zanzibar.

Today, Prison Island offers visitors a chance to explore its rich history and enjoy the natural beauty of the surroundings. The island is accessible by boat from Stone Town, with regular tours and excursions organized for tourists.

One of the main attractions on Prison Island is the population of giant tortoises, some of which are over a century old. These impressive creatures were originally a gift from the Seychelles, and they have become an iconic symbol of the island. Visitors can observe and interact with these gentle giants, feed them, and learn about their conservation efforts.

In addition to the tortoises, Prison Island boasts beautiful sandy beaches and clear turquoise waters, making it an ideal spot for swimming, snorkeling, and sunbathing. The coral reefs surrounding the island are home to a diverse array of marine life, making it a popular destination for snorkelers and scuba divers.

For those interested in history, a visit to the old prison building is a must. Although it was never used as a prison, the building still stands and now houses a small museum dedicated to the history of the island and the region.

Prison Island offers a unique blend of history, natural beauty, and wildlife, making it a captivating destination for visitors to Zanzibar. Whether you're interested in exploring the island's past, interacting with giant tortoises, or simply relaxing on the beach, Prison Island provides a memorable experience for all who visit.
